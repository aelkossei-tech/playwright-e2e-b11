** INTERVIEW QUESTION: What is something you've contributed in your previous company? **
    - Seeing that there's a need for test-ids in my previous company, I took the initiative to ask the development team to include
      test-ids within their source code to create a faster, more efficient testing workflow --> eventually they created a company policy 
      becuase of it 


XPath* --> //button[@id='register_button'] ==> another way of locating elements + you can locate to parent (unlike CSS)
    1. Find all buttons
    2. Filter the buttons which has id attribute 
    3. Filter the id equals register_button

CSS --> button[id='register_button']
    1. Find the id which is register_button

//tagName[@attribute="value"] (XPath)  === tagName[attribute="value"] (CSS)

CSS                                 XPath
tagName[attribute^="value"]; === // button[starts-with(@id, 'register)]
tagName[attribute*="value"]; === // button[contains(@id, 'register)]
tagName[attribute$="value"]; === // button[ends-with(@id, 'register)]

Playwright supports XPath
Cypress DOES NOT support XPath (but there is a dependency)
Selenium supports XPath
They ALL support CSS and have their own locators
