API (Application Programming Interface)==> allows diff. software applications to communicate w/ each other 
    - as SDETs --> we'll see the connection between UI and API 
    - There are a few types of APIs: 
        1. REST (Represenetational State Transfer)* [we'll be using this most of the time] 
        2. SOAP (Simple Object )
        3. GraphQL 

    - How does API work? 
        - The client sends a request --> server processes the request and sends back a response
